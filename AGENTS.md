> Commits you push to the connected branch sync back to Lovable and show up in

- Keep the TanStack portfolio and standalone GitHub Pages index.html aligned for requested content and presentation changes; the standalone entry must work without a framework server.
- Store uploaded documents and certificate media as asset pointers; React reads the pointer URLs and the standalone entry uses verified absolute asset URLs to work outside Lovable.
- Download the resume as a fetched Blob with an explicit filename rather than relying on a cross-origin download attribute, which browsers may ignore.
